        Twelve years before the start of the series, the ninja village of
        Konohagakure was attacked by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. The village was
        only saved from complete destruction by the actions of Konoha's leader,
        the Fourth Hokage, who sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a
        newborn: Naruto Uzumaki.
